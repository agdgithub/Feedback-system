# FeedbackSystem
A Web Based Solution For Collecting And Retrieving The Feedback From End Users

## Installation


1. Change into the project directory:

```
cd feedback-system
```

2. Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../feedbackSystem
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the Feedback System website, you'll need to have MongoDB running in the background.

1. Open a terminal and start the MongoDB server:

```
mongod
```

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```
cd /path/to/feedback-system/frontend
```

3. Run the frontend development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `feedbackSystem` directory:

```
cd /path/to/feedback-system/feedbackSystem
```

5. Run the backend server:

```
npm run dev
```

Both the frontend and backend servers should now be running, and the Feedback System website should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
